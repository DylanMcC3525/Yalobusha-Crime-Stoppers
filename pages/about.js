      Yalobusha County Crime Stoppers
      encourages members of the community to
      assist local law enforcement agencies in the
      fight against crime by overcoming the two key
      elements that inhibit community involvement -
      fear and apathy.  Crime Stoppers provides a
      telephone number and Web Tips to encourage
      citizens in the community to volunteer vital
      information helpful to law enforcement
      agencies to fight against crime.  Callers
      remain anonymous and are eligible to receive
      a cash reward if the information given leads to
      an arrest or grand jury indictment of a felony
      offender.

      Since the inception of our local program in 2006
      the “TIPS Hotline,” as it is more commonly
      known, has taken numerous tips from concerned
      citizens. Those tips have aided in the arrests of
      several criminals and the clearing of recent some
      felony cases or warrants. Since it is a well-
      documented fact that criminals tend to keep
      committing crimes, the sum total of arrests from
      Crime Stoppers tips has undoubtedly prevented
      other crimes from occurring.
